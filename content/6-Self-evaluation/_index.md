During my internship at **AWS First Cloud Journey** from **08/09** to **24/12**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply cloud computing knowledge to real-world scenarios while developing a comprehensive understanding of AWS services.

I participated in **developing the Coffee Cloud – Coffee Shop Order Platform project**, a full-stack serverless application using ReactJS, C#/.NET Lambda, and multiple AWS services including Amplify, DynamoDB, Cognito, API Gateway, SNS, and SES. Through this project, I improved my skills in **cloud architecture design, full-stack development, project documentation, technical presentation, and AWS service integration**.

Additionally, I actively participated in **4 major AWS technical events** including AI-Driven Development, AI/ML workshops, DevOps practices, and AWS Security best practices, which significantly enhanced my knowledge of cutting-edge cloud technologies and industry trends.

In terms of work ethic, I demonstrated strong self-direction in learning complex AWS services, maintained detailed weekly work logs, created comprehensive project documentation, and consistently engaged with the AWS community through events and workshops.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:

### What I Accomplished During Internship

**Technical Learning:**
* **Learned about Coffee Cloud project** - Got hands-on experience with AWS services like Amplify, Lambda, and DynamoDB
* **Basic AWS understanding** - Gradually learned how different services work together in a serverless architecture
* **Improved coding skills** - Practiced with ReactJS and C#/.NET, though still have much to learn
* **Cost awareness** - Learned to be mindful of AWS costs and how Free Tier works

**Learning Attitude:**
* **Attended AWS workshops** - Participated in 4 events to learn about AI, DevOps, and Security (still processing a lot of the information)
* **Kept work records** - Maintained weekly logs and documented what I learned from events
* **Tried to document properly** - Created project documentation, though it took me longer than expected
* **Asked questions** - When I didn't understand something, I tried to research and ask for help

**Personal Growth:**
* **Stepped out of comfort zone** - Attended community events even though I was nervous about networking
* **Persistence** - Kept working on tasks even when they seemed challenging at first
* **Responsibility** - Tried my best to complete assignments and meet deadlines
* **Honest about limitations** - Acknowledged when I needed more time to understand concepts

### Areas I Need to Improve

**Technical Skills:**
* **Problem-solving approach** - Need to develop better systematic thinking when facing technical challenges
* **AWS service integration** - Still learning how to properly connect different services together
* **Code quality** - Need more practice to write cleaner, more efficient code
* **Understanding architecture** - Basic knowledge is there, but need deeper understanding of design principles

**Professional Skills:**
* **Communication** - Need to get better at explaining technical concepts clearly, especially when presenting
* **Time management** - Sometimes take longer than expected to complete tasks
* **Confidence** - Working on being more confident when discussing technical topics or asking questions

**Work Habits:**
* **Consistency** - Need to maintain steady progress rather than rushing at deadlines
* **Detail orientation** - Sometimes miss small but important details in documentation or code
* **Initiative** - Could be more proactive in seeking additional learning opportunities
* **Efficiency** - Learning to work smarter, not just harder
